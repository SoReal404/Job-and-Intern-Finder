# 🎯 Internship Finder AI (with Streamlit + NLP)

A smart internship finder that uses AI to match you with the most relevant internship opportunities based on your resume or skills. It uses `sentence-transformers` to semantically compare your profile to real internship descriptions and ranks them by relevance — so you only see the best-fit ones.
